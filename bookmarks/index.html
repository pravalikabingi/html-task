                <h1>chapter1:Small habits make a big difference</h1>
                <p>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable— sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s  how  the math works out: if you can  get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. Focus on getting 1 percent better every day.

                The key to Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits.Changing your beliefs isn’t nearly as hard as you might think. There are two steps.Decide the type of person you want to be.
                Prove it to yourself with small wins.
                Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

                    <h1>chapter1:Deep Work is valuable </h1>
                    <p>
                        Chapter 1: Deep Work is valuableWith the rise of digital technology, labor markets have changed dramatically. In their book “Race Against the Machine”, Erik Brynjolfsonn and Andrew McAfee say that we live in the era of the Great Restructuring – a time when technologies are advancing at a high speed while the skills of ordinary workers fall behind. This creates a gap between human and technological resources, and it means employers will more likely hire smart machines than people. The good news is that while many people risk being thrown out of this new economic reality, there are still groups of workers who have a potential to win. These are:The High-Skill Workers. These are workers who are able to work with complex machines and get valuable results. A great example of such a worker is Nate Silver – an American statistician who analyzes data and makes forecasts using the Stata system, a tool that requires a lot of learning. For people like him, machines are not obstacles but rather a means that help achieve goals.The Superstars. E-mails and virtual meeting software make it possible to hire the best workers instead of people who are available because they live next to your office. For example, if you need a programmer, you can hire David Hansson, one of the best in the world, and the fact that he’s on a different continent would not mean anything to your company. But, as Newport pointed out, this would definitely mean something to less-skilled programmers who live right in your area.

                <h1>chapter2:Deep Work is rare </h1>
                <p>
                    In recent years, curious trends in the business sphere have appeared. The first trend is the open office concept. This policy was adopted by Facebook, as well as many other Silicon Valley companies. By having people work in a common space, leaders hoped that they could learn from one another.The second trend is instant messaging. It has nothing to do with chatting; its goal is to raise productivity and save customer’s time. Finally, the third trend is maintaining a social media presence. For example, the New York Times encourages its editors, photographers, and writers to maintain a Twitter account. These three trends are very paradoxical, says Newport. Open space, instant messages, and social media presence do not promote deep work. But, as we see from Chapter 1, deep work is exactly what  helps individuals work effectively. Yet organizations do not support it; what they support is a culture of connectivity. But why is this so?

                <p>
                    In this chapter Newport discusses deep work from the viewpoint of three arguments: neurological, psychological, and philosophical.A Neurological Argument for DepthGoing through a serious life drama as she was diagnosed with cancer, a science writer Winifred Gallagher discovered an interesting connection between attention and happiness. Instead of focusing on suffering and pain, she decided to focus on “movies, walks, and a 6:30 martini”, and noticed that this worked better than she could think: this period of her life, expected to be dark, appeared to be quite pleasant. Management of attention worked a miracle. Our problem, says Newport, is the assumption that circumstances always determine how we feel. However, our worldview is constructed by our brain. This means that we can choose what to concentrate on. It applies to work as well. Even more, as the author says,

                    <p>
                        We have a flawed concept of time that infuses our lives with false expectations,needless stress, and wasted opportunities for true happiness.Our modern idea of "time management" is a trap:• We think of time as a resource to be assigned to specific containers• Containers such as... work, rest, leisure, etc. that are not allowed to overlapFour Thousand Weeks confronts the reader with the sobering truth that an 80-year lifespan includes just over four-thousand weeks. Burkeman suggests that people should accept this time limitation rather than try to be endlessly productive and busy throughout their lives. He shows that while modern technology promises to cut down menial tasks, such as going to grocery store or calling a local cab company, technological convenience has done little to enhance our satisfaction in life or give us more time to complete our goals. Efficiency in itself does little to enhance happiness.

                <p>
                    Worrying about the future is another temporal challenge that limits our experience of autonomy over time. The increased pace of modern life has led to more impatience and less of a focus on the present; people avoid being present in favor of imagining a hypothetical future in which our plans will take shape. This is accompanied by ceaseless productivity and outsized rage at slow-moving things—traffic or toddlers—because they do not comply with the pace at which life should move. While having a packed schedule is seen as the norm, Burkeman points out that this makes it more difficult to collaborate with others. This makes life lonelier and diminishes the potential of meaning and enjoyment. We must therefore consider whether having control over one’s schedule is worth it if it gets in the way of meaningful relationships.

                    "Finitude": What we can actually achieve and do within our lives has a severe setof limitations.One of them is time: assuming you live to be eighty, you only have about fourthousand weeks.Burkeman ends his book with 10 tools for embracing our temporal limits, such as limiting oneself to a 10-item to-do list, deciding in advance that we will fail in some areas of life, and consolidating our caring strategies to focus on one important cause above 20 that we engage in superficially. Finally, he advocates that we practice doing nothing, in order to come to terms with the limits of our existence as it is in the present and make wiser decisions about time-use from there.While the distracting-by-design aspects of social media are in part responsible for shortened attention spans and our inability to focus on important, difficult tasks, we unconsciously opt into distractions when we encounter boredom or come to a roadblock in a challenging project. Online distractions, including social media, provide the perfect forms of procrastination and sort-term gratification.

                    After high school, McConaughey spends a year on an exchange in Australia; while he is initially lured there on the premise of balmy Sydney beaches, he spends his exchange with an eccentric and disciplinarian family, the Dooleys. In order to cope with the ordeal, he practices abstinence and becomes a vegetarian. McConaughey later reflects that this experience taught him both endurance and introspection, which were valuable tools for his acting career.While McConaughey initially wants to go to law school, his passion for storytelling ultimately leads him to film school. There, McConaughey spends more time hustling for industry work than attending lectures and is soon able to talk himself into a role in Richard Linklater’s 1993 film Dazed and Confused. It is during this time that his father dies—during a lovemaking session with McConaughey’s mother.

                    McConaughey with an intense feeling of responsibility to boldly pursue his Hollywood ambitions. He draws on this to seek challenging principal roles, rather than the small ones initially offered to him, ultimately making a name for himself in romantic comedies. Eventually, McConaughey is unchallenged by playing romantic leads and begins to seek new adventure in his life. This new path to adventure arrives through two wet dreams, which lead him to the Amazon rainforest and then to Mali. Each trip is a formative venture, enabling McConaughey to challenge himself and deepen his self-knowledge.While McConaughey has many fleeting romantic involvements, it isn’t until his mid-30s that he meets Camila Alves, the Brazilian model who ultimately becomes his wife and the mother of his three children. McConaughey’s acting career pales in comparison to his vibrant family life, and he abstains from accepting any more unfulfilling roles. After a period of 20 months, he finally attracts the type of challenging dramatic role he craves: his role as Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers’ Club (2013) earns him an Academy Award. However, even as McConaughey is reaching the peak of his career, he finds that box-office figures are dropping off, largely because going to the movies is less popular. In 2019 he becomes Minister of Culture at the University of Texas and the City of Austin, striving to make a more significant impact in society by enforcing good values and competence. He reflects that he hopes his memoir will both entertain readers, as well as help them learn from his life experiences.

                        War and Peace begins in Saint Petersburg (Petersburg) in 1805, at a soirée hosted by Anna Pavlovna, whose fancy parties are frequented by Russian aristocrats. The hostess playfully attacks Prince Vassily Kuragin, her first guest, speaking to him in French. She accuses him of wanting to make excuses for the "Antichrist," "Buonaparte," the French conqueror who has recently annexed two Italian principalities. As the conversation progresses, it becomes clear that Russia, along with its ally Austria, will soon be at war with France. Anna Pavlovna speaks with great fervor, claiming that the Russian emperor will save Europe. Vassily complains about his dissolute second son, Anatole, but says that both of his sons are imbeciles. His hostess suggests she can facilitate a match for Anatole with the rich Princess Marya Bolkonsky, who lives an unhappy life with her eccentric, strict father.

Prince Vassily is accosted on his way out by Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskoy, an impoverished elderly princess with former high connections. She persuades Vassily to intercede with his contacts to get her son Boris an appointment with the imperial guard—reminding Vassily that her father had helped him get ahead in his younger days. At the party a French viscount speaks against the upstart Napoleon, while Pierre defends him, saying he has reined in the excesses of the French Revolution.Andrei is about seven years older than Pierre, who is 20. In Chapter 5 Andrei invites Pierre to his house after the soirée, and in the subsequent chapter they continue their conversation. Andrei plans to go to war since he is fed up with society and his shallow wife. Pierre admires his friend for his calmness, intelligence, and rationality. Andrei warns Pierre to stay away from Anatole, but after Pierre leaves he meets up with Anatole; his wild companion Dolokhov, who gambles and drinks to excess; and the rest of young Kuragin's army buddies.
